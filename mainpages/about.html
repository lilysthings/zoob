  <body> 
    <p> My full name is Lillian Zhang, but my friends call me Lily and you can too! I was born and raised in the metro Atlanta area to Chinese immigrant parents. I grew up in one place and made the big jump to chase the New York dream. Since, I've attended NYU Stern studying finance while exploring a minor in public health or history. I've explored different roles in startups and am excited to pursue more roles in the future. Other than my studies, I enjoy travel and art. My favorite city I've been to is by far Amsterdam, and my favorite artist at the moment is Wassily Kandinksy. Would love to chat - drop a line anytime! </p>
